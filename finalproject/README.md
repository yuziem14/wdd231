## MovieTrack Site Plan

### Site Name: MovieTrack – Track what you’ve watched. Discover what’s next.

**Rationale:** The name "MovieTrack" clearly communicates the primary function of the web application: tracking movies. The tagline "Track what you’ve watched. Discover what’s next." further clarifies its purpose, highlighting both organizational and discovery aspects for users. It's concise, memorable, and directly relevant to the content.

### Scenario Questions

To understand the user experience and ensure the site meets its objectives, here are some scenario questions from the perspective of a target audience member:

1.  "I just finished watching a movie and want to add it to my 'watched' list. How quickly can I find it and mark it as watched?"
2.  "I'm looking for a new movie to watch. Can I filter movies by genre (e.g., 'Sci-Fi') or by a high rating to find something good?"
3.  "I remember seeing a movie on the site earlier but can't recall its name. Can I search for it, and then view its details in a pop-up?"
4.  "I want to make sure my watchlist is saved even if I close my browser. Will the site remember my 'favorite' movies or my 'watched' status?"
5.  "I want to suggest a movie that isn't on the site yet. Is there an easy way to submit new movie information?"
