          <h2>
            Site Name: MovieTrack – Track what you’ve watched. Discover what’s
            next.
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Rationale:</strong> The name "MovieTrack" clearly
            communicates the primary function of the web application: tracking
            movies. The tagline "Track what you’ve watched. Discover what’s
            next." further clarifies its purpose, highlighting both
            organizational and discovery aspects for users. It's concise,
            memorable, and directly relevant to the content.

          <p>
            To understand the user experience and ensure the site meets its
            objectives, here are some scenario questions from the perspective of
            a target audience member:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              "I just finished watching a movie and want to add it to my
              'watched' list. How quickly can I find it and mark it as watched?"
            </li>
            <li>
              "I'm looking for a new movie to watch. Can I filter movies by
              genre (e.g., 'Sci-Fi') or by a high rating to find something
              good?"
            </li>
            <li>
              "I remember seeing a movie on the site earlier but can't recall
              its name. Can I search for it, and then view its details in a
              pop-up?"
            </li>
            <li>
              "I want to make sure my watchlist is saved even if I close my
              browser. Will the site remember my 'favorite' movies or my
              'watched' status?"
            </li>
            <li>
              "I want to suggest a movie that isn't on the site yet. Is there an
              easy way to submit new movie information?"
            </li>
          </ol>
